# Pandell Pre-Interview Problem

A simple node.js solution to the problem 'Please write a program that generates a list of 10,000 numbers in random order each time it is run. Each number in the list must be unique and be between 1 and 10,000 (inclusive).'

## How To Use

1. Install Node Package Manager.
2. Navigate to the folder containing the uncompressed code in a command console.
3. Run the command 'npm start' to create generate the list of integers as a string.

I've also included a test function (that you can run with the command 'npm test') that returns true if the output of the function follows the above rules.
